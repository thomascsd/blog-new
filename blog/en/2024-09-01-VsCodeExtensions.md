This time I want to share with you some VSCode extension packages that I think are very useful. These packages may not be very popular, but I think they are very practical. Of course, we all know well-known packages like ESLint and GitLens, so I won't mention them again. Please refer to them.

## [Separators](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.separators)

The function of this package is very simple. A dividing line appears above the `function` or `method`, turning the program into blocks.

## [TabOut](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=albert.TabOut)

This function is as shown in the icon above. Press the `tab` key to jump to the next block. This is a function I have been looking for, because `Visual Studio` has a similar function, which adds great convenience.<br>

## [Project Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.project-manager)

Generally speaking, it is often necessary to switch between different projects during development. This package will automatically import projects that use git for version control by default, and it also has the functions of adding `favorites` and setting tags. It is a very practical package.<br>

## [Version Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pflannery.vscode-versionlens)

Sometimes, we need to check whether the installed package is the latest version, and we hope to be able to update it quickly. This package can achieve this purpose.
<br>

After installing the package, when in `package.json`, you can press the V button in the upper right corner.

After waiting for a while, the version number information will appear above the package.

In this way, you can quickly update to the latest version, and finally execute `npm install` to complete.<br>

## [Readme Pattern](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thomascsd.vscode-readme-pattern)

Finally, I would like to recommend a package I developed myself, which can sometimes quickly add a ReadMe.md template.

## Conclusion

In short, VSCode's extension packages do have many choices, and the community is also very active. I hope that some of the less well-known but practical packages I introduce can bring some help to everyone's development work. Enhancing functions and improving efficiency are the original intentions of our use of extension packages. I hope everyone can also enjoy it and find the extension package that suits them.
