With the rapid development of IT technology, various new concepts and programming frameworks emerge in an endless stream, and are updated every year. Therefore, I think reading more articles is a very effective way. Next, I want to introduce two article collection websites (Echo.js and Daily.dev). In addition, I will also share some tool-type websites that I usually collect.

## [Echo.js](https://www.echojs.com/)

<img class="img-responsive" loading="lazy" src="assets/images/32/32-01.png">

The content of the website is mainly to summarize front-end technology articles. Anyone can register and post articles of interest. Recently, I have read this website less, mainly because I am looking at the next website.

## [daily.dev](https://daily.dev/)

<img class="img-responsive" loading="lazy" src="assets/images/32/32-02.png">

You can refer to a previously written [article about daily.dev](https://thomascsd.github.io/blog/2020-09-05-IntroducingDailyDev). Also, because the previous interface and functions are too different from the current ones, I took this opportunity to rewrite this article.

## [devdocs](https://devdocs.io/)

<img class="img-responsive" loading="lazy" src="assets/images/32/32-03.png">

This is a website that centralizes documents of various languages, libraries, and frameworks, and it is also an [Open Source project](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/devdocs).

One of the features is that the search spans across various documents. For example, searching for `date` will return results from various related documents.

## [regex101](httpshttps://regex101.com/)

When developing regular expressions, you need to confirm whether the regular expression is correct, and at this time you need a convenient tool. [regex101](https://regex101.com/) is the best of the tools I have tried.
As shown in the figure above, when we enter `^09\d{8}$` to match the mobile phone number, the explanation of the rule will be displayed in the right column, and the input test data will also be highlighted, which makes the process of testing and debugging more convenient.

## [it-tools](https://it-tools.tech/)

<img class="img-responsive" loading="lazy" src="assets/images/32/32-06.png">

A recently discovered tool-type website, which is an [Open Source project](https://github.com/CorentinTh/it-tools), contains many small tools required for development, such as Base64 encoding, string comparison, and IP calculation.

For example, as shown in the figure above, sometimes you want to quickly generate a UUID for use.

## Conclusion

With the continuous evolution of technology, mastering the latest tools and resources is crucial for developers. I hope that the websites and tools introduced above can help you to be more efficient and convenient in the process of learning and development.
